## Installation <a name="installation"></a>
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

•	Fetching and cleaning real estate historical data, conduct exploratory data analysis for predicting hidden trends in different real estate markets. Specific area data analysis to perform the best investment strategy (nightly average price, time series analysis for analyzing seasonality).

•	Simulated the effect of several features by applying machine learning to train predictive models to estimate housing value and best asking price. The results are compare in single variate, multivariate regression and polynomial regression algorithms to analyze and solve complex business problems while using the L1 and L2 regularization to fix the overfitting issues. K-nearest neighbor and local regression are also applied for house price predicting.

•	Performed analyses that help answer business questions for a variety of clients. This involves extracting and manipulating data from one or more retail databased, determining and executing the appropriate analysis on the data.

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>
There are 6 notebooks with 6 different algorithm available here to showcase work related to the above questions.
The notebooks contains my steps for making the conclusion based on the data analysis of factors affecting the reservation prices. Detail explanations are included to help  you walking throught process.
The algorithm includes:  <br />
•Single variate and multivariate regression; <br />
•polynomial regression and over-fitting;<br />
•L1 and L2 regularization; <br />
•K-nearest neighbor and local regression<br />
